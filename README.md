# digitalstore

 DigitalStore is an e-commerce web application focused on selling digital codes (e.g., license keys, vouchers, gift codes). Users can register, log in, browse products (codes), make purchases, and receive their codes automatically. An admin panel will be included for managing inventory, orders, and refunds. I built this to handle the massive amount of digital codes I was selling manually everyday to help reduce my manual workload :)

Digital Code Inventory: Each product can have multiple associated digital codes that get marked as sold upon purchase.

Shopping Cart: Add products to cart, update quantities, remove items, or clear the entire cart.

Order Workflow: Once an order is placed, the associated digital codes are flagged as sold and the user receives them.

Basic Admin Capabilities: Admin can fetch and manage users


## Getting Started:

Run git clone https://github.com/yourusername/digitalstore.git

Run GenerateJwtSecret.java to get a fresh 256-bit secret.

Set up MySQL (via Docker Compose): docker-compose up -d



Below is my Docker Compose file
```
version: '3.8'

services:
  mysql:
    image: mysql:8.0
    container_name: mysql_db
    restart: always
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: 
      MYSQL_DATABASE: 
      MYSQL_USER: 
      MYSQL_PASSWORD: 
    ports:
      - "3306:3306"
    volumes:
      - mysql_data:/var/lib/mysql
#adminer is optional but I find it helpful
  adminer:
    image: adminer
    container_name: adminer
    restart: always
    ports:
      - "8081:8080"

volumes:
  mysql_data:
```
